# IoT-Based Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring Using GPS

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an IoT-based vehicle tracking and monitoring system using GPS and GSM technologies. The system allows real-time vehicle tracking, providing the vehicle’s location via GPS coordinates. It also monitors vehicle health parameters such as speed, fuel level, and temperature.

For detailed information, refer to the [IOT_PROJECT.pdf](IOT_PROJECT.pdf.pdf) file.

## Objective
- Track the location of the vehicle in real-time using GPS.
- Monitor vehicle health parameters (e.g., speed, fuel level, temperature).
- Provide alerts in case of emergencies or unauthorized movements.
- Display the real-time location on a map for easy tracking.

## Components Used
- **GPS Module**: For obtaining real-time location coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the vehicle.
- **GSM Module**: For sending SMS alerts to the user in case of emergencies or predefined events.
- **Microcontroller**: Typically Arduino or Raspberry Pi, for controlling and interfacing the GPS and GSM modules.
- **IoT Platform**: For remote monitoring and displaying data in real-time (e.g., ThingSpeak, Blynk, or a custom web server).
- **Sensors**: Depending on your project, you may use sensors like accelerometers, fuel sensors, or temperature sensors for monitoring vehicle conditions.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Location Tracking**: GPS module tracks and sends coordinates periodically.
- **SMS Alerts**: In case of emergencies, the system can send SMS alerts using the GSM module.
- **Speed Monitoring**: The vehicle's speed is monitored, and alerts can be sent if it exceeds a certain threshold.
- **Fuel Level Monitoring**: Fuel sensor monitors the fuel level and sends updates to the monitoring system.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: If using an engine temperature sensor, it can alert when the vehicle overheats.
- **Geofencing**: Set up a virtual boundary for the vehicle. Alerts are triggered if the vehicle enters or leaves the predefined area.

## System Architecture
- The system uses the **GPS module** to determine the vehicle’s real-time location.
- The **GSM module** sends SMS notifications in case of unauthorized movements, speeding, or other alerts.
- Data from the **vehicle sensors** (e.g., speed, fuel level, temperature) is sent to the IoT platform for monitoring.
- The data is displayed on a dashboard, which can be accessed by the vehicle owner via a web or mobile application.

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** or **Raspberry Pi setup** (if you're using a Raspberry Pi).
- **ThingSpeak/Blynk** (for IoT monitoring and data visualization).
- **Google Maps API** (optional, if you want to show the location on a map).
- **SIM800L library** (for GSM communication with the Arduino or Raspberry Pi).

## Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino UNO** or **Raspberry Pi**.
- **GPS Module** (e.g., Neo-6M).
- **GSM Module** (e.g., SIM800L).
- **Various sensors** (e.g., fuel sensor, temperature sensor).
- **Jumper wires, breadboard, and power supply**.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Connect the GPS and GSM modules to the microcontroller following the pin configuration provided in the documentation.
3. Install necessary libraries (e.g., GPS, GSM) in the Arduino IDE or set up the Raspberry Pi environment.
4. Upload the code to the microcontroller (Arduino or Raspberry Pi).
5. Set up an IoT platform account (e.g., ThingSpeak, Blynk) and configure it to receive and display data.
6. Power up the system and monitor the vehicle's location and health parameters.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [IOT_PROJECT.pdf](docs/IOT_PROJECT.pdf.pdf) file.

## Working
- The system continuously tracks the vehicle’s GPS location and sends updates to the IoT platform.
- If the vehicle exceeds the speed limit or deviates from the planned route, the GSM module sends an alert to the owner.
- Health parameters, such as fuel level and temperature, are continuously monitored and sent to the platform.
- The vehicle's location is displayed on a map (using Google Maps API or IoT platform visualization).

## Future Enhancements
- **Mobile App Integration**: A dedicated mobile app can be developed for easier access to real-time data.
- **Voice Alerts**: Voice alerts can be integrated using speakers for vehicle notifications.
- **Automatic Emergency Response**: In case of an emergency (e.g., vehicle crash), the system can automatically notify emergency services.
- **Advanced Geofencing**: Set up dynamic geofencing based on the vehicle's movement and real-time location.

## Conclusion
This IoT-based vehicle tracking and monitoring system offers a comprehensive solution for vehicle management, providing real-time data and alerts for better decision-making and vehicle security. For additional details, please refer to the [IOT_PROJECT.pdf](docs/IOT_PROJECT.pdf.pdf) file.
